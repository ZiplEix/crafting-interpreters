# CRAFTING INTERPRETERS - following the [book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom

In this repo I will be following the book and implementing the code. The book is about crafting interpreters and it is divided into two parts: the first part is about implementing an interpreter for a simple language called Lox (written in Java) and the second part is about implementing a bytecode virtual machine for the same language (written in C).
